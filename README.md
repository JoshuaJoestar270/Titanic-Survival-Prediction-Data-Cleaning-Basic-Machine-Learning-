Titanic Survival Prediction (Data Cleaning + Basic Machine Learning)
Title / Repo Name Suggestion: titanic-survival-prediction-ml
Description:
End-to-end analysis and prediction of passenger survival on the Titanic using the seaborn-built-in dataset.

Performed thorough data cleaning (handled missing values, encoded categorical features, feature engineering like family size).
Conducted exploratory visualizations (survival rates by gender, class, age distribution).
Built and evaluated a baseline Random Forest classifier (scikit-learn) with train/test split, accuracy, and classification report.
Highlighted key factors influencing survival (women and 1st-class passengers had significantly higher rates).
Showcases full data science workflow: cleaning, EDA, feature engineering, modeling, and interpretation.

Tech Stack: Python, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn
