# Titanic Survival Prediction (Data Cleaning + Basic Machine Learning)

End-to-end data science workflow to predict passenger survival on the Titanic using the seaborn Titanic dataset.

### Overview
Conducted a complete analysis and prediction project on the Titanic disaster dataset to identify survival patterns.  
- Performed thorough data cleaning: handled missing values (age, embarked), encoded categorical features (sex, embarked), and engineered new features (family size)  
- Explored data through visualizations: survival rates by gender, passenger class, age distribution, and other key variables  
- Built and evaluated a baseline Random Forest classifier using scikit-learn with train/test split  
- Assessed model performance via accuracy score, classification report, and key factor interpretation  
- Revealed strong survival influences: women and 1st-class passengers had significantly higher survival rates  

Demonstrates full data science pipeline — data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, modeling, and result interpretation — ideal for entry-level data science and machine learning roles.
